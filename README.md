### Data Sources
---
The primary Data used here is the SalesData provided by the Incubator Hub

### Tools Used

- Github for portfolio building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
----
After getting the data, I performed the following:
- Data loading and inspection
- Removal of duplicates
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
This invoives exploring the data to answer pertinent questions such as:
- What is the total sales for each product category
- What is the number of sales transaction in each region
- What is the highest-selling product by total sales value
- What is the total revenue per product
- What is the monthly sales total for the current year
- Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount
- What is the percentage of total sales contributed by each region
- Identify products without sales in the last quarter

### Data Analysis
---
Structured Query Language (SQL) was used to query data
```SQL
SELECT * FROM [LITA SalesData]
```
```SQL
SELECT Product, 
       SUM(Quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM  [LITA SalesData] 
GROUP BY Product;
```
```SQL
SELECT Region, 
       COUNT(*) AS OrderID
FROM [LITA SalesData]
GROUP BY Region;
```
```SQL
SELECT TOP 1 Product, 
       SUM(Quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM  [LITA SalesData]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```
```SQL
SELECT Product, 
       SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM [LITA SalesData]
GROUP BY Product;
```
```SQL
SELECT 
    DATENAME(MONTH, OrderDate) AS SalesMonth, 
    SUM([Quantity]) AS TotalSales
FROM 
    [LITA SalesData]
WHERE 
    YEAR(OrderDate) = YEAR(GETDATE()) 
GROUP BY 
    DATENAME(MONTH, OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate)
ORDER BY 
    MONTH(OrderDate);
```
```SQL
SELECT TOP 5 [Customer_Id] , 
       SUM([Revenue]) AS TotalPurchaseAmount
FROM [LITA SalesData]
GROUP BY [Customer_Id]
ORDER BY TotalPurchaseAmount DESC;
```
```SQL
SELECT Region, 
       SUM([Quantity]) AS TotalSales, 
       ROUND((SUM([Quantity]) * 100 / (SELECT SUM([Quantity])
	   FROM [LITA SalesData])), 2) AS PercentageSales
FROM [LITA SalesData]
GROUP BY Region;
```
```SQL
SELECT Product
FROM [LITA SalesData]
WHERE Product NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT Product
    FROM [LITA SalesData]
    WHERE OrderDate >= DATEADD(QUARTER, -1, GETDATE()))
GROUP BY Product;
```

### Insights Generated
---
Regional Performance:
The pie chart and bar chart visualizations on regional performance highlight the revenue and sales rates generated by each region. The South region leads with a rate of 44.16%, generating $928K, followed by the East at 23.13% with $486K, the North at 18.42% with $387K, and the West at 14.29% with $300K. The significant gap between the South and the other regions indicates that the other regions may be underperforming with certain products, possibly due to the stores not aligning with customer needs based on regional preferences or environmental factors.

Product Performance:
The bar and column charts visualize the sales revenue generated by each product. The product with the highest revenue is shoes, generating $613K, followed by shirts at $486K, hats at $316K, gloves at $297K, jackets at $208K, and socks, which generated the least at $181K. These variations could also be linked to regional customer demand and preferences.

### Recommendations
Targeted marketing campaigns focusing on the most popular products in each region should be conducted. Additionally, offering discounts and promotions on less popular products can help boost sales in those categories. Furthermore, consider moving high-demand products to the regions where they are most needed, such as transferring shoes (which perform well in the South) to that region, as they generate over $500K, compared to only $30K in the West. This strategy would help minimize profit loss and improve customer satisfaction.

Management needs to focus marketing efforts on promoting high-performing products like shoes, shirts, and hats across digital and social media channels. For lower-performing products, consider positioning them as complementary items to encourage upselling. Additionally, analyze demand trends to anticipate spikes in sales, adjusting stock levels accordingly to prevent potential revenue loss.
